# Goals for Challenge

The main focus of this challenge will be to continue my education of Front-End development following the [Front-End Developer Roadmap](https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap) by [kamranahmedse](https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap/commits?author=kamranahmedse).

## Starting Out
As of September 21st, 2018, I have 2 years of Front-End development work experience focused primarily in using HTML, TypeScript/JavaScript and 3rd party component libraries (e.g. [Kendo UI](https://www.telerik.com/kendo-ui), [Vuetify](https://vuetifyjs.com/en/)). I have an understanding of component-based design and have started to be more exposed to the Vue.js framework through my current work position.

## Plan (in this order)
* [x] Strengthen current JavaScript skill by learning ES6 features
* [ ] Fill knowledge gap of CSS3
* [ ] Refresher on Package Managers
* [ ] Learn about CSS Preprocessors
* [ ] Learn BEM CSS Architecture
* [ ] Learn Build Tools (Webpack, ESLint, NPM Scripts)
* [ ] Pick framework and build application using it

## Thoughts at Start of Challenge
Having never received a formal education in Front-End development, following this roadmap will help keep my education pointing in the correct direction. There is a clear path of how each step builds upon the previous. I am excited to learn all of these technologies and will have to show restraint not to jump ahead of myself during this learning process.

Combining this with the nature of the 100DaysOfCode challenge, I will become more confident in my skill set as a Front-End developer going into 2019!
