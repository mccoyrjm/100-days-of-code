# Goals for Challenge

The main focus of this challenge will be to continue my education of Front-End development following the [Front-End Developer Roadmap](https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap) by [kamranahmedse](https://github.com/kamranahmedse).

## Starting Out
As of September 21st, 2018, I have 2 years of Front-End development work experience focused primarily in using HTML, TypeScript/JavaScript and 3rd party component libraries (e.g. [Kendo UI](https://www.telerik.com/kendo-ui), [Vuetify](https://vuetifyjs.com/en/)). I have an understanding of component-based design and have started to be more exposed to the Vue.js framework through my current work position.

## Plan (in this order)
* [x] Strengthen current JavaScript skill by learning ES6 features
* [x] Fill knowledge gap of CSS3
* [x] Learn about CSS Preprocessors
* [x] Learn BEM CSS Architecture
* [ ] Pick framework and build application using it

# Thoughts at Start of Challenge
Having never received a formal education in Front-End development, following this roadmap will help keep my education pointing in the correct direction. There is a clear path of how each step builds upon the previous. I am excited to learn all of these technologies and will have to show restraint not to jump ahead of myself during this learning process.

Combining this with the nature of the 100DaysOfCode challenge, I will become more confident in my skill set as a Front-End developer going into 2019!

# Thoughts at Halfway Point (aka Day 50)
**Related:** [Upcoming Day 50 thoughts](./log/day-047.md)

As timing would have it, it's been exactly 4 months since I started #100DaysOfCode! A lot of changes were happening in my life and an important one was deciding to get more involved in my field which meant getting up to speed on more relevant Front-End technologies. So what happened this past third of the year?

## JavaScript ES6

The first fourth of this challenge consisted of reinforcing my JavaScript skills. My C# background and more recent experience with TypeScript made this the easier goal to achieve as well as getting me into the groove of coding everyday. This was during a time where I was coding for this challenge purely after work, so not a huge amount of progress was made compared to more recent entries. (Not to say that was a negative since  that is the whole point of this challenge: "code for at least 1 hour a day".) Wes Bos' [ES6 for Everyone!](https://es6.io/) course and Dr. Axel Rauschmayer's [Exploring ES6](http://exploringjs.com/es6/index.html) book were invaluable resources.

## CSS3

This was the primary goal for this challenge since I previously did not have a high confidence using it. But after the past 27 days worth of work, it's crazy to see the progress I've made! Thanks to my work situation, I've been able to spend 6+ hours a day going through the [CSS - The Complete Guide](https://www.udemy.com/css-the-complete-guide-incl-flexbox-grid-sass/) course which has a curriculum that continues to build off previous units and has a nice progression to it. I've even been able to answer a couple of StackOverflow questions to give back to the community and reinforce my teachings.

## Feelings

Overall? Pretty happy with what I've accomplished! I still have a bit to go with CSS, but I feel like I'm entering an intermediate level of understanding with it since I know the basics along with how to explain a few (seemingly) quirky behaviors. Predicting the rest of this challenge will allow me to finish up the course ok and get a good CSS foundation. In the future, I'll have to continue learning on my own and keeping up with the changes/updates.

## Improvements
I've seen some people say they've "failed" the challenge because they've missed a day or two. In my case, I've definitely not been consistent and at some points ignored the challenge for weeks:

1. lack of discipline the first time
2. 3-week project that required overtime

However, I certainly don't consider this time spent on this challenge a failed attempt. At the end of the day, I'm better off than where I was 4 months ago and continued learning is a main part of what this challenge is about.

That being said, I will work on my discipline moving forward. There have been days where I've felt I couldn't get a good coding session in because I didn't have the 6+ hours I've been used to. For those situations, I need to go ahead and spend my minimum hour coding while maintaining my learning pace and be ok with not getting as much done that day. Although I've been given a great opportunity at work to spend that time on learning, I shouldn't be dissuaded when that inevitably comes to an end.

## Goals Check-In

While the [Front-End Developer Roadmap](https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap) was modified since my start date, my goals are still fine where they are. If anything, I can trim off a few due to briefly going over those subjects during this first half of the challenge. Therefore,  I will be removing _Refresher on Package Managers_ and _Learn Build Tools (Webpack, ESLint, NPM Scripts)_ from my expected goals out of this challenge.This gives myself more time to focus on finishing CSS and to start work on an actual web application. When I run into issues setting that up, I'll learn what I need to at that point regarding build tools and the like.

Speaking of, I've decided that my web app will be I will be a game tracker application using the [IGDB API](https://www.igdb.com/discover). Being a game collector, I've always liked the idea of making my own tracker that allowed me to not only track progress of games I own, but also of games I have/haven't played.

## Halfway Point Conclusion
Will continue work on the last half of this challenge with great enthusiasm and a better sense of what I'm working towards! Thanks for reading and happy coding everyone!
