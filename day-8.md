# Day 8: September 28, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Read article by [Maya Shavin](http://mayashavin.com/?source=user_profile---------------------------) about the differences between an **Object** and a **Map**. Exposed to reasonings behind using one versus the other and learned about behaviors of some Map functions.

**Thoughts:** Glad to have discovered Maya and have a better understanding of when to use **Maps** vs **Objects**. I'll certainly be thinking about that when solving problems in the future and feel like I have acquired a new tool under my belt. Feels good!
