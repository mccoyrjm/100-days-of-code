# Day 19: November 7, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Module topics covered:
* Upgrades made to object literals
* Promises
* Symbols (new primitive type)

**Thoughts:** I enjoy learning how to write things with less syntax but still be descriptive, so the object literals module today was especially interesting. Promises were also good to learn. It's my understanding that before await-async, that was the main way to structure synchronous code. Will have to evaluate the pros and cons of each and how they're both used in modern web dev.
