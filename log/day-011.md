# Day 11: October 1, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Went through 1st module of Wes Bos' "ES6 for Everyone!" course.

**Thoughts:** Feel like I've got a good handle of a lot of ES6 features, so I want to go over them again in the form of a course to reinforce what knowledge was gained. It'll be important to retain this information when working with frameworks and tackling new problems down the line.

**Learning Resources:**
