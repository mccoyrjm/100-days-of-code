# Day 10: September 30, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Figured out that with yesterday's WeakMap example code, I must not have been completely nulling out the button object key. After trying another example based off a tutorial by [Wes Bos](https://wesbos.com/), I got a WeakMap example working.

I then started reading another article by [Maya Shiva](http://mayashavin.com/) and learned the differences between a Set and an Array.

**Thoughts:** Had to not dive as deep into WeakMaps today in order to keep my learning momentum up. Not feeling too bad about it since I have an idea of what I did wrong yesterday and got another example working ok.

As for learning Sets, feel like I have another tool under my belt now and am glad to have that understanding of when they are more applicable.
