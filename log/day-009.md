# Day 9: Setptember 29, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Learned about WeakMaps, how they are similar to Maps and how they allow garbage collection while Maps do not.

Attempted to replicate behavior based off examples I was looking at, but could not get garbage collecting to work. I created an HTML page that used a WeakMap to store the # of times individual buttons were clicked. Each entry used the button as a key, so I expected that removing the button from the DOM would trigger the garbage collection and delete that WeakMap entry.

Will have to debug more tomorrow.

**Thoughts:** Starting to run into my first roadblock with understanding a programming technique. All the same, it's something that was bound to happen sooner or later! Will be walking away from this now and hoping to figure out the answer next session.
