# Day 16: October 17, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Reviewed new ES6 string functions.

**Thoughts:** Able to get back into the groove of #100DaysOfCode after dealing with interviews the past few days. Excited to have things lined up and get back to coding!

This session was another example of thinking you know about some things, but then learning that the .endsWith() function has a second parameter that makes it so it analyzes only the first *n* characters of the string. Who woulda thought!
