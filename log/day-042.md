**Today's Progress:** `background-origin` and `background-clip` properties

**Thoughts:** Glad to finally have the know-how on how to resize background images. Similar concepts to `box-sizing` were brought up today, so that was good to make sure I still understood that property. Will review `background-clip` some more due to some unexpected behavior, so that'll be for tomorrow.
