# Day 29: November 23, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Started work on clone of [ddlc.moe](https://ddlc.moe).

**Thoughts:** Couldn't access * [CSS - The Complete Guide](https://www.udemy.com/css-the-complete-guide-incl-flexbox-grid-sass/) course on Udemy due to Black Friday server load, so took the advice of [@06b](https://twitter.com/06b?lang=en) and started cloning the [ddlc.moe](https://ddlc.moe) site to practice CSS. I've already learned a few more CSS properties due to trying to replicate the styling exactly (listed below).

**Link(s) to work:**
* DDLC Clone - [GitHub](https://github.com/mccoyrjm/ddlc-clone)

**Learning Resources:**

* background - [CSS MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background), [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21374534/css-background-image-not-loading)
