**Today's Progress:** CSS Properties associated with page layout such as `position` and `z-index`

**Thoughts:** It's crazy to read about all the work that has gone into laying out elements properly using CSS. Using vanilla CSS helps me understand what more experienced Front-End developers had to go through to style things properly. It'll be interesting to see how tools such as CSS Grids and Flexbox have achieved popularity by being better alternatives to styling than what I'm going through now.
