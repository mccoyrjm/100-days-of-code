# Day 56: January 28, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Completed work on "Attribute Selectors Tutorial" (Added remaining selectors, made web app responsive, adjusted highlighting and example markup).

**Thoughts:** Calling this project done for now! Tried my best to polish it up and I know it can be better. Once I've reached further grounds with my CSS learning, I'll have the chance to come back and improve/rewrite this. For now, I'm happy with it and hope it proves useful for the community!
