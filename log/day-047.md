**Today's Progress:** Pre-Halfway Point Thoughts

**Thoughts:** Spent the better half of the first day thinking about the changes I want to make regarding different aspects of my life (finances, lifestyle, health, community involvement, relationships, etc). Self-development-wise, my halfway mark through this challenge is coming up which makes me stop & think how things are progressing. Am I happy continuing my original [goals](../goals.md)? Am I learning what I need to for my current situation? Can I be learning more efficiently? By this Friday, I will be thinking about this and making adjustments as needed to things. Considering how difficult it is for my personality to collect coherent thoughts, it's good to start thinking about this now.

As for today's work, we're looking at different CSS units and learning out the differences between em vs. rem units!
