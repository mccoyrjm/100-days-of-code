# Day 70: March 16, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Started on CSS Transitions.

**Thoughts:** Already I'm seeing the potential CSS3 Transitions can bring to the table for an effective user experience. And learning about some of the behavior of it as well is interesting. Today, I learned that Google Chrome fires off transitions on page load, so you have to put a script tag with a single whitespace in it to stop that behavior from occurring. (Apparently, it is a known bug in chrome.)
