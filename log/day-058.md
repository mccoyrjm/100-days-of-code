# Day 58: January 30, 2019

**Today's Progress:** How to add custom fonts, the different properties that directly affect font/text and a introduction of a property that assists font load performance and behavior. Got started on Flexbox as well on the Advanced Track of the course!

**Thoughts:** This module turned out to be more interesting than I expected! Can already see how importing custom fonts can personalize a site and what precautions I need to take when doing so in order to account for site performance. It's tempting, but you can't get to crazy with importing fonts!

Also had time to proceed to the advanced track of the course and start learning Flexbox. After doing a #flexbox search on twitter, I found this [tweet](https://twitter.com/alyshaj08/status/1090043900813701120) promoting a game to learn & practice Flexbox which was such a fun way to get up to speed on this! 24 levels later and I feel like I already understand the idea of what Flexbox is capable of. :)
