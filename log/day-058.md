**Today's Progress:** How to add custom fonts, the different properties that directly affect font/text and a introduction of a property that assists font load performance and behavior.

**Thoughts:** This module turned out to be more interesting than I expected! Can already see how importing custom fonts can personalize a site and what precautions I need to take when doing so in order to account for site performance. It's tempting, but you can't get to crazy with importing fonts!
