# Day 75: March 26, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Continued learning SASS/SCSS. Went over the following features:
* Nesting Selectors
* Nesting Properties
* Variables
* Lists & Maps
* Built-In Functions

Worked through exercise practicing how to improve a provided stylesheet using SASS.

**Thoughts:** SASS makes you think with a different perspective of how to keep things DRY and re-usable. It's opening my eyes to how I can better organize my CSS code. It reminds me of JavaScript because the nesting is like `if {}` statements and the variables are like... well, variables (`let, const`)!
