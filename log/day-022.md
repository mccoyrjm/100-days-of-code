# Day 22: November 11, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Started learning ES6 Tooling by using SystemJS and browser-sync.

**Thoughts:** Not much done today, but trying to take my time and read documentation and properly learn about introduced technologies rather than just following the code sample in the tutorial. A slower more analytical approach will lead to a better understanding of new concepts.
