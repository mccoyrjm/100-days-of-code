# Day 99-100: August 22, 2019 & August 24, 2019

**Progress:** Integrate [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) into development workflow. Learn about differences between using individual plugins and presets that contain sets of plugins.

**Thoughts:** It was easy to understand what Babel's purpose is. It was harder integrating it. Feeling comfortable with the tool now after seeing a need for it at my work and playing around with it in a demo project.

Been on a kick recently of wanting to understand how to build a web project in a modern way. Will move onto integrating it into Webpack for future learning.

This also marks my 100th day of learning and the challenge completing itself. :)

**Resources**
* [Babel Docs](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/)

**Work**
* [Babel-RequireJS Repo](https://github.com/mccoyrjm/babel-requirejs) - Project practicing using an [AMD](https://github.com/amdjs/amdjs-api/wiki/AMD) Module Loader and Babel to output IE11 compatible code.
