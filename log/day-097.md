# Day 97: August 13, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Experimented with PostCSS CLI. Got it working with `autoprefixer` and `postcss-simple-vars` plugins.

**Thoughts:** Good first impressions with PostCSS (even after a couple hours of trial and error getting the CLI to work). I remember learning SASS and thinking it had a bunch of cool features, but I wouldn't be using all of them. PostCSS allows for only what you want which gives it a clearner feel. Once I get a better understanding of build processes and bundlers, I'll have to integrate that into future projects.
