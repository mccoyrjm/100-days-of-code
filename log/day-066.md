# Day 66: March 11, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Practiced with CSS Variables and researched when it's appropriate to use them.

**Thoughts:** I've started a new project at work where I'm the head UI guy! For only having 6 months of CSS under my belt, it's been challenging, but I've been enjoying this side of the Front-End. I ran into a problem last week where I kept re-using the same properties and wanted a way to store them in a variable. Enter "CSS Variables"!

Unfortunately, IE11 does NOT support this feature (a phrase that is quite common when working in this neck of the woods). While I've read about how to work with other features like CSS Grid and Flexbox while still supporting IE11, this seems like something that I just can't use if the backwards compatibility is of higher importance. I can write the entire CSS to support variables, but it overall feels more dirty to do so.

The question continues to be asked: what tools do I not know about that would be the proper solution here? The hunt continues..
