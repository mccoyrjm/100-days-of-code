**Today's Progress:** Practice with rem & `vh` and `vw` units

**Thoughts:** Replaced our course sample site `px` values with `rem` and got more practice with that. Moved onto using `vh` and `vw` units and where it's appropriate to use those.

Almost done with the "units" unit! Excited to wrap this up.
