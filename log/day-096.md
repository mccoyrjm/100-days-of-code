# Day 96: August 11, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Created new app with Vue CLI and started re-writing code into this app. Got build setup using Netlify.

**Thoughts:** Challenges thus far have been deciding how to configure project for what tools I wish to use, learning curve of Vuetify (lots of referencing the docs) and picking back up on Vue.js after not using it for a while.
