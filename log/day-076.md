# Day 76: March 28, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Continued learning SASS/SCSS. Went over the following features:
* Simple Arithmetics
* Using `@import` to make one generated CSS file
* Improved `@media` queries
* Inheritance
* Mixins
* Ampersand Operator

Worked through exercise practicing how to improve a provided stylesheet using SASS.

**Thoughts:** Working through more advanced topics of SASS has been inspiring me to incorporate it into my projects. One hurdle is adding it to an already existing project, so I found a good article by **Brian Krall** from late 2013 (wow SASS has been around that long!) that defined a good path to take with that endeavor.
