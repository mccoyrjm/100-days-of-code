# Day 3: September 23, 2018

**Today's Progress:** [Jacob M-G Evans](https://twitter.com/JacobMGEvans) followed up on yesterday's post that led me to go over more object and array destructuring. 

**Thoughts:** Even though I planned to learn more ES6 features, I'm glad Jacob commented on yesterday's status update. At the end of our discussion, I felt more confident in desctructuring (especially after he confirmed my answers were correct) and also some insight on when it's useful to destructure objects/arrays.

It goes to show it takes practice to truly learn something! I will have to spend some time during my daily coding to review what I previously learned to make sure everything sticks.
