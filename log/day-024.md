# Day 24: November 13, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Having completed first goal of reinforcing my JavaScript ES6 knowledge, today continued into my 2nd goal by starting [Academind](https://www.academind.com/)'s course on CSS3.

**Thoughts:** Excited to be getting to this goal!! I've always been interested in creating good GUIs since I started and now I'm going to be invested in working with a language that does just that. This will be my 2nd attempt at going through this course. However, I am more confident that by going through with this challenge and a better focus of what I want to accomplish, I will be able to better retain what I learn!

Sidenote: Using [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/) now for my project snippets. Recommend giving it a look!
