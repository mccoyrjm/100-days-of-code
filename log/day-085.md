# Day 85: May 4, 2019

**Today's Progress:** More work towards responsive design of [ddlc.moe](https://ddlc.moe) clone.

**Thoughts:** Added more responsive tweaks like making the disclosure message at the bottom naturally responsive (removed `<br>` from middle of text) and adjusted layout of the footer elements using a `@media` query.

Next session will start to use more `@media` queries to create layouts for tablets and desktops!
