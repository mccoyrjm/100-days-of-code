# Day 82: April 28, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Explored VSCode extensions and returned to working on clone of [ddlc.moe](https://ddlc.moe).

**Thoughts:** After attempting to start working with a framework yesterday with not much progress, I decided to return to my DDLC clone site project just to have a project with a clear goal set up that can be used to integrate other web dev tech I've been researching. Today was refactoring the CSS styling and markup with my modern knowledge of CSS. A LOT of improvements were made with browser compatibility in mind and I was able to get a lot done!

**Learning Resources:**
* [How I configure VSCode for Everything](https://dev.to/amanhimself/how-i-configure-vscode-for-everything-23c9?utm_source=digest_mailer&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=digest_email) by [Aman Mittal](https://dev.to/amanhimself)
* [Pure CSS Parallax Websites](https://keithclark.co.uk/articles/pure-css-parallax-websites/)

**Link(s) to work:**
* DDLC Clone - [GitHub](https://github.com/mccoyrjm/ddlc-clone)
