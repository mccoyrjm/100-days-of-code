# Day 54: January 26, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Worked more on "Attribute Selectors Tutorial"

**Thoughts:** Although later than usual, today's code session was a nice diversion from the typical "going through the CSS course" agenda we've been at for the past month's worth of this challenge. It's nice to build stuff and to create a resource that the community can utilize as well!
