# Day 36: December 3, 2018

**Today's Progress:** CSS `float` property (cont.)

**Thoughts:** Getting the impression that `float` still has modern day uses, but most of the time you would vouch for using FlexBox or something else. Still a handy thing to understand and recollected some styling issues at my last job where I had to pull sections of html to the right side of a section. Things are clicking every day!
