# Day 79: April 2, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Attempted to re-implement making CSS Variables in IE11 work using [ponyfill](https://github.com/sindresorhus/ponyfill). IE11 "SCRIPT: Access is denied." errors causing roadblock in progress.

**Thoughts:** I'm thinking I'm tired and and wishing IE11 out of the box would work.
