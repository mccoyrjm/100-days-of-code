**Today's Progress:** Initial Setup & Tech Stack

**Thoughts:** I'm vulnerable to getting hung up on the proper way to do things. That mindset has blocked me from starting this project, so I've decided to just develop with what technologies I'm familiar with now and see if a need arises to add something else. The only technology I've added so far is an express back-end server where I'll be making my calls towards the [IGDB API](https://api.igdb.com/) and my game collection database.
