# Day 64: February 7, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Started over with CSS Grid via an written tutorial as opposed to video.

**Thoughts:** Recently, I had the realization that I enjoy learning from documentation/articles as opposed to video tutorials. Both have pros and cons and the biggest one I see is that articles excel at answering specific questions but don't always go into detail. While video tutorials can tackle specific questions, they tend to take more time doing so (even at 1.5x playback speed).

With my current CSS course, I've been trying to combine the two when I can while making sure to go through each video. However, I'm starting to feel drained from doing this and recently saw a [tweet](https://twitter.com/DavidMM1707/status/1093227108070055938?s=20) that used the term "Tutorial Purgatory" which is a good way to describe being stuck with going through tutorial content.

Going forward, I'm going to continue following along with the CSS course and other video content as needed (to enhance explanations and such), but will shift learning from written articles/documentation. I've enjoyed creating content like that myself and perhaps in the future I'll work on tutorials similar to the ones I'm using currently.

I am feeling drained but also hopeful that committing more to my preferred teaching style will yield better results in the near future!
