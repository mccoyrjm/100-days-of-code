# Day 44: January 11, 2019

**Today's Progress:** More work on uHost sample site and watched videos on filters and gradients.

**Thoughts:** Feeling drained today to be honest. Feels like I've been on the "images" unit for a good while and am looking forward to the next unit on CSS units.

Spent most of today's efforts helping out someone on Stack Overflow. Took a few hours, but I believe OP found what he was looking for in the end. Felt good to help out and test my knowledge of CSS!
