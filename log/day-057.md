# Day 57: January 29, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Completed "Styling Forms" course module and started on "Work with Text and Fonts"

**Thoughts:** Thought fonts would be a more mundane topic, but after making another tutorial snippet about using fonts, it helped cement the knowledge in my noggin. Plus future Ryan will thank me for making easy to use references like this. :)
