**Today's Progress:** `vertical-align` property, CSS Pseudo Classes

**Thoughts:** Didn't get to do a dedicated exercise towards `vertical-align` yesterday, so spent the first half of today reviewing that in a CodeSandbox. Like I wrote yesterday, slow and steady understanding of topics!

Have also reached the point I did last time I attempted this "CSS - The Complete Guide" course and am feeling much better regarding the knowledge "sticking" this time around. The exercises I've been doing along with the course have helped cement the knowledge I've been accruing and am looking forward to the rest of the course!
