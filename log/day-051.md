**Today's Progress:** Started on Media Queries and refactoring sample site to be responsive

**Thoughts:** Enjoying "mobile-first" design more and more. It makes development easier when you have a base idea of how things act by default and THEN use @media queries to adjust behavior when it gets larger. Much more of a "ground-up" approach.

Ended up spending a bit of time on an Overwatch themed sample web app that practiced media queries! It was such fun that I had to stop myself from adding different features so I could focus on practicing media queries! ^_^;
