# Day 40: December 29, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Intro to `background` and `background-size` properties.

**Thoughts:** Diving back into the coding everyday rhythm! Wrapped up a short-term project yesterday, so am trying to get back into the everyday coding groove for the challenge. Even if it's not in the spirit of doing it straight through, I'm still committed to finishing 100 days.

To jump back in, I started the next module of the Udemy CSS course I've been following about working with backgrounds. This is a topic I've been looking forward to and feel I'll get more out of it with my CSS foundation built up thus far.
