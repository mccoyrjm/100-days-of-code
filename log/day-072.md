**Today's Progress:** Reviewed centering elements with Flexbox.

**Thoughts:** Got hung up for a majority of the work day running with the assumption that IE11 couldn't handle basic Flexbox centering (targeting an image and a paragraph). Gave it a shot tonight and it works just fine. Oy...

Planning on implementing this into my project tomorrow and learned that you shouldn't do extra work to make something cross browser compatible without FIRST confirming it isn't in the first place...
