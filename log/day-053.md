# Day 53: January 25, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Start on "Styling Forms" module and code snippet on Attribute Selectors.

**Thoughts:** Learned about Attribute Selectors and want to make a more detailed-than-usual CodeSandbox explaining how they work. Inspired by [Learn CSS Positioning in Ten Steps](http://www.barelyfitz.com/screencast/html-training/css/positioning/), I'd like to make an interactive web app explaining attribute selectors. This will help give back to the community as well as assist me practice with using JS and CSS in tangent with one another.
