**Today's Progress:** More CSS Classes techniques & behaviors, #100DaysOfCode Twitter Community, Course Sample Site

**Thoughts:** Had more twitter activity today which was a fulfilling experience! Had a nice back and forth with [@TheCodePixi](https://twitter.com/TheCodePixi?lang=en) and gave feedback to [@Paul_Duvall](https://twitter.com/Paul_Duvall?lang=en) regarding a CodePen project he had whipped up.
