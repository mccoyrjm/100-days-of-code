# Day 62: February 5, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Went through CSS Grid Garden game and started course module on CSS Grid.

**Thoughts:** I'm ready to be done with this course and to start applying everything I've learned to a personal project. I'm still looking forward to learning CSS Grid, animations and SASS, but I'm ready to start applying this knowledge somewhere!

In other news, Tuesdays continue to be the most tiring days of the week. Zzzzz
