# Day 26: November 16, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Read about 'Browser Error Handling', worked on CSS basics exercise and reviewed the Box Model.

**Thoughts:** Update on "weird CSS behavior" issue from yesterday: my markup turned out to be invalid and the topic of 'content categories' was brought to my attention explaining why the written markup did not match what was rendered. These moments of unexpectedly learning things makes me feel like I'm getting slowly mastering the nuances of working with a technology. (Check out the discussion on this [twitter thread](https://twitter.com/_RyanRealMcCoy/status/1063446043034116100).)

Back to course content, I have actually done this portion of the course before. However, instead of relying solely on the example being used to teach, I have been making my own CodeSandbox snippets. This helps with focusing on core topics and experimenting with them.
