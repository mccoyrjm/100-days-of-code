**Today's Progress:** Continued with CSS Transitions and how to setup different transitions within the same element.

**Thoughts:** Sometimes I get caught up with styling the forms better but I can't help myself! ^^; Glad to be diving into some of the features CSS3 Transitions brings to the table. Excited to start on more animations tomorrow.
