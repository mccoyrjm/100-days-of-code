# Day 23: November 12, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Got working sample of browser-sync set up. Attempted to use SystemJS 2.0, but found the documentation lacking and there aren't many up to date examples since [2.0 was released](https://guybedford.com/systemjs-2.0) on 9-28-2018.

Skimmed through more of Wes Bos' course and went over await-async flow control.

**Thoughts:** Felt more antsy today about applying all of this ES6 knowledge which is why I skimmed through the rest of the course. Now planning on finally filling that CSS3 knowledge gap!
