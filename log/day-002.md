# Day 2: September 22, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Continuing on with JavaScript ES6! Learned about **destructuring**, the [Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/getOwnPropertyDescriptor) function and refreshed my understanding on **for-of** loops.

**Thoughts:** Having come from a C# background, I was familiar with **for-each** loops which are equivalent to ES6's **for-of**. Even with that familiarity, I still made new discoveries going over **for-of** loops (e.g. how to return the element AND element index using **destructuring**). It goes to show that it's always good to refresh yourself on a topic because either you're totally up-to-date on it or you learn something new!
