# Day 98: August 14, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Experimented more with PostCSS CLI. Integrated `stylelint` and successfully got files set up where the correct errors were being fired and autocomplete & emmet features were working in VSCode. At a point now where I can focus on what plugins to use for my development style.

**Thoughts:** Took almost a full work day's worth to configure, but happy to have played with PostCSS.  It feels like modding my PC version of Skyrim in a way. PostCSS is the mod organizer and all of the plugins are the mods. I'm already scared how knee-deep I can get into downloading plugins upon plugins. D:
