# Day 65: February 9, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Practicing CSS Grid via following along with [Learn CSS Grid](https://learncssgrid.com/).

**Thoughts:** While I did have a nice lunch with my mentor about web dev, I consider yesterday a missed day since there wasn't much actual coding.

Today, however, was filled with much CSS Grid practice and things are starting to not feel as overwhelming! The order in which Jonathon Suh has put different CSS Grid properties in has been methodical and easy to learn from. For now, getting comfortable using CSS Grid is the primary goal and I can worry about the nuances and weird behaviors when I actually use it. I'm at a point where I understand the history of CSS Layout and why CSS Grid is a major game changer, so it will be on my list of things to keep on top of and utilize in future projects.

Finding a quality, written tutorial was challenging, but worth it in the end to adhere to my learning style. :)
