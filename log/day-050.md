# Day 50: January 21, 2019

**Today's Progress:** CSS+JS, Responsive `<meta>` Tag & "Mobile First"

**Thoughts:** So excited to get into responsive design! This is a HUGE part of building modern sites and I one of my goals for CSS was to get more comfortable with media queries and the whole "Mobile-first" philosophy. I have tried to see first-hand why that is the way to go in a previous project and had to redo some work by going with "Desktop-first" design. Learning about the `<meta>` tag for responsive design was cool as well! I didn't know how many options were controlled via that tag. It's essentially like the On/Off switch for if your site is responsive or not.

**Bonus:** Now that I have reached Day 50, it's time to reflect on how things are going at this halfway point (write-up will be in [goals section](../goals.md)).
