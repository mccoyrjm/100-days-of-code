# Day 15: October 12, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Looked into how to write TypeScript declaration files in an attempt to contribute to [vue-application-insights](https://github.com/latelierco/vue-application-insights).

**Thoughts:** Been hearing more about Hacktober 2018 lately and a problem at work encouraged me to learn how to create declaration files for a package that we want to use. I ran into the same issue wanting to use [vue-cropperjs](https://github.com/Agontuk/vue-cropperjs) and figured it'd be a good thing to pick up!

Predicting it will take a few sessions more to understand how to interpret JavaScript to TypeScript declaration files as well as learn best practices.
