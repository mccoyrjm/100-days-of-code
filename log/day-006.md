# Day 6: September 26, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Today was not too productive due to a lack of interest in Arrays and then focus on what to learn. Concluded with making ES6 Maps and Sets tomorrow's goal.

**Thoughts:** Was able to avoid this issue the first 5 days, but having a lack of focus on what you want to learn can certainly crush your productivity. After glancing over the new Array methods in ES6, I couldn't think of situations where I could apply them which made me disinterested in continuing. Having listened to [@SyntaxFM](https://twitter.com/syntaxfm) recommend learning Maps(), I decided to make that my next goal.

Tomorrow should go smoother now that I have a clearer learning path laid out!
