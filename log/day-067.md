# Day 67: March 12, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Started learning about CSS Transforms.

**Thoughts:** Planning on spending the next couple of days on CSS Transforms and  Transitions. I'm getting more eager to start a personal project and feeling like that'll be something more exciting to come back to than a course at this point. So I'll be learning the basics of these topics to make sure I know these techniques exist before putting more effort into learning them thoroughly.
