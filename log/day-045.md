# Day 45: January 13, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Finished up course module on images.

**Thoughts:** Added SVGs to site and wrapped up module on images and background images! Also checked back into Stack Overflow and got some good reputation points (finally enough to upvote answers and comments), so hoping to help out more on there where I can.
