# Day 31: November 26, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Explored `display: inline-block` elements' behavior and the CSS `vertical-align` property.

**Thoughts:** Having attempted to take this course before, I'm finding this 2nd attempt more successful due to a different learning approach. Taking my time and analyzing each property's behavior in its own CodeSandbox has helped tremendously. It gives me a greater appreciation for how schools give sample exercises for homework. I did the best on assignments that required me to dive into the topic a bit more with self research and understand the topic in-depth (which is exactly what I've been doing here). I've been finding myself less wanting to speed along a course and rather be slow and steady to understand everything. :)
