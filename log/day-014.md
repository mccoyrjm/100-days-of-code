# Day 14: October 9, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Learned about Tagged Template Literals.

**Thoughts:** Couldn't honestly get into a productive mood today, so didn't get through as many Wes Bos videos as I hoped. Need to throw my phone in the other room from now on during these sessions.

**Link(s) to work:**
* Tagged Template Literals - [JS Bin](https://jsbin.com/tequkelobo/edit?js,console)

**Learning Resources:**
* [ES6 for Everyone!](https://es6.io/) course by [Wes Bos](https://wesbos.com/)
