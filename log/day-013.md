# Day 13: October 8, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Reviewed arrow functions via an exercise (since I've missed a couple days) and also was more exposed to working with DOM Element objects. Then started reviewing template literals.

**Thoughts:** Glad I was able to retain arrow functions knowledge and once again learned a few new things while going through the exercise (namely how to chain array functions and the difference between innerText and outerText).

**Link(s) to work:**
* es6.io arrow functions exercise - [HTML](https://github.com/mccoyrjm/100-days-of-code/blob/master/log-work-files/arrow-functions-exercise.html)

**Learning Resources:**
* [ES6 for Everyone!](https://es6.io/) course by [Wes Bos](https://wesbos.com/)
* innerText vs. outerText - [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18481382/what-is-the-difference-between-innertext-and-outertext)
