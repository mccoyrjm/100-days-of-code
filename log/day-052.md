# Day 52: January 24, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Finished making uHost site responsive. Attempt at resizing a background cover photo image to be responsive.

**Thoughts:** Meant to practice CSS logical operators, but ended up struggling to get an image to be responsive. Throughout the course, I've found dealing with images challenging and am planning on setting up a meeting with my mentor for some hands-on tutoring. Hoping to get a better understanding of how to handle this after receiving their guidance.

Glad we're done refactoring the site to be responsive! It's cool to see it acting so dynamic and now I have a great appreciation for "mobile-first" design.
