# Day 77: March 29, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Focus on Future-Proof CSS.
* CSS Variables
* Vendor Prefixes & when to use them
* `@supports`
* Polyfills

Completed [CSS - The Complete Guide](https://www.udemy.com/css-the-complete-guide-incl-flexbox-grid-sass/)!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

**Thoughts:** At long last, I have finally gotten through the main topics of the CSS course on Udemy I have been going through since last November!

While admittedly not going through every video, my goal of getting first-hand exp learning each module topic was accomplished. Figuring out my learning-style midway through the course also played a part as I felt more engaged learning directly from written articles/documentation than I did watching videos near the end (especially with topics like CSS-Grid and Flexbox). The course still did a great job walking me through what I should look at and going into the "quirky" aspects of CSS.

Quite happy with my progress and looking forward to continue advancing my knowledge!
