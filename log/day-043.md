# Day 43: January 10, 2019

**Today's Progress:** `background-clip` property, continued work on [uHost](https://codesandbox.io/embed/vm3qvyj283?view=preview) Course Sample Site and explored behavior of white space under `<img>` elements.

**Thoughts:** Figured out yesterday's behavior with `background-clip` and have a better understanding of how it works now along with the difference between it and `background-origin`. When continuing onto working on the uHost site, the instructor briefly went over an interesting issue where white space would be displayed underneath an `<img>` element when a border is applied to the parent container. A good explanation of this was written up by [Michael_B](https://stackoverflow.com/users/3597276/michael-b) as to why this occurs.

These are the moments I enjoy most when learning CSS, the weird/quirky behaviors you stumble upon!
