# Day 81: April 22, 2019

**Today's Progress:** ESLint and Babel

**Thoughts:** Loving learning about this build tools stuff! Being a pretty organized person, it's always fun to set things up perfectly and then watch everything execute nicely to achieve a goal. It's also fascinating how so many different technologies are able to come together into one system and work coherently with each other!
