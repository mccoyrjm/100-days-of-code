# Day 17: November 5, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Jumping back into Wes Bos' ES6 for Everyone course with reviewing template strings from (last session), destructuring objects and destructuring arrays.

**Thoughts:** The fun part about today's session was that it was at work! I'm lucky to now be working at a software consulting company that invests in their employees education. We're encouraged to spend time in-between project learning new skills to further increase our worth. Taking full advantage of the that available time to learn, learn, learn!
