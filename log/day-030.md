# Day 30: November 24, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Continued work on clone of [ddlc.moe](https://ddlc.moe). Not much development, rather familiarizing myself with future styling problems I'll need to address.

**Thoughts:** Was introduced to styling problems I was unfamiliar with how to tackle. Starting to understand the learning process of how cloning sites are going to help me learn CSS:

1. Pick site to clone site
2. Copy styling exactly via current knowledge-base, but research techniques for solving issues as needed
3. At end of cloning, reference actual site's code to see how it was done
