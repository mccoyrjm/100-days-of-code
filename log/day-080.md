# Day 80: April 21, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Evaluation of current interests in learning after completing CSS Course. Researched build tools tech ESLint.

**Thoughts:** Felt aimless after completing CSS course and have had a few weeks at work that left me unmotivated to program. Shocked to see that I haven't coded since April 2nd thinking that it had only been a week off from the challenge. Although I was focused on other self-improvement endeavors such as exercise and mental health, can't help but feel disappointed in myself.

Will work to correct efforts towards challenge this week.
