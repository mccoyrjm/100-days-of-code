# Day 18: November 6, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Due to having 100% of my time at work allocated to this course, got through a TON of material today!
* Destructuring
* Iterables & Looping
* Array functions
* Spread Operator

**Thoughts:** The important theme of today is curiosity. I'm learning that trait is more and more important to have the further I dive into different technologies. Not only does this apply to developers, but to anyone wanting to dive into a subject. The only thing standing between you and mastery of it is your level of curiosity and willingness to dig deeper.

Going through so many of Wes Bos' modules granted a perspective into his teaching style. It's evident that his curiosity is one of his strongest characteristics that has helped him gain a deep understanding of the technologies he uses. It's no surprise why his tutorials are easy to follow based on the way he explains topics.
