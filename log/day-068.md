# Day 68: March 13, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Continued learning about CSS Transforms.

**Thoughts:** The urge to just start on my personal project is getting extremely tempting. I want to stand by what I wrote down yesterday and get through a few more modules of CSS.

Interesting tidbit about `transform: translate()`: if you use percentage values, it bases the translation off the width/height respective to which x or y axis you are translating it on!
