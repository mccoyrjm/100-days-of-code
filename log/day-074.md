# Day 74: March 24, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Started learning about SASS/SCSS.

**Thoughts:** Like most of my learning, a topic seems complicated until you dive into it. I remember first being described SASS from my mentor and being overwhelmed with concept of having CSS generated for you (granted this was before I really even wrote my first line of CSS). Now that I'm getting into it however, I'm already seeing how beneficial this tool can be in my work! For example, I've been learning about Material UI and they provide theming options that specifically uses SASS in order to customize. Will definitely be bringing this up to my colleagues and trying to incorporate it into the codebase.

I'm also obsessed with organizing things, so any tool that helps accomplish that better is a plus in my book!
