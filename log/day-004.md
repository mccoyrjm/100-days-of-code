# Day 4: September 24, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Learned about default parameters and how useful the spread operator is!

**Thoughts:** Pleasantly surprised at discovering the spread operator. Can already see a number of situations where this will be useful and wishing I knew about it sooner! (Waves of problems I've solved in the recent past that could have implemented this are rushing through my memory banks!)
