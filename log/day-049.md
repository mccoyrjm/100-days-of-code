# Day 49: January 17, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Finished "CSS Units" course module, referral call for previous co-worker, helping on StackOverflow and started "CSS & JS" course module.

**Thoughts:** Got a call from a recruiter today and talked about a past co-worker for a referral! It was such a pleasure to discuss them and help them out like they helped me at my past work. Goes to show to keep in touch with the people you meet. Wishing them the best in their job hunt!

Similarly, helping out on StackOverflow is a nice way to test my current understanding of CSS. I approach questions I think I can handle more like a pop quiz and try to give a detailed answer (more so in case someone calls me out on incorrect information! Haha).

More work done on the uHost site for finishing up working with CSS Units and we moved onto implementing functionality that required JavaScript. It's been fun to have them interact more with each other having not dealt with it too much in my past. Honestly, I've felt like it's bad practice to implement interactions between JS and CSS this way since there's typically another way via the framework you're using to handle that kind of interaction. Will have to look into that.
