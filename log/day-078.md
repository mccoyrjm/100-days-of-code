# Day 78: March 31, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Explored Visual Studio Code extensions and what I want to do next.

**Thoughts:** Having a tutorial course gives me structure on what to work on, so it's understandable feeling aimless after finishing up. Referring back to my goals for this round of #100DaysOfCode, my next step is to build an application using my refined CSS skills.

I still feel unprepared to build a fully-fledged project not knowing about build tools and how to incorporate different pre-processor technologies and transpilers like Babel. Coming to that realization has indirectly helped me pick a focus for the next round of #100DaysOfCode. :) I originally planned on not going with a round 2, but there is still so much to learn and skills to refine. Having this schedule of programming everyday has been a good incentive to keep at it, so that'll continue to fit into my daily schedule after completing this round.
