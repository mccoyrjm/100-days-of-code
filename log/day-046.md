**Today's Progress:** 3 Rules on % Unit

**Thoughts:** Started on CSS units and focused on how using % on applicable properties (ex. `width`) targets a specific container based on the element's `position` style. I haven't encountered any unexpected behavior during my learning of CSS when using % units on properties, but it was nice to get a deeper understanding of what actually affects how a % translates to a calculated length value.
