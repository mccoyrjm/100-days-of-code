# Day 20: November 8, 2018

**Today's Progress:** ESLint 101 (Getting started, enabling/disabling rules, extensions, plugins, etc.)

**Thoughts:** From using TSLint at my last job, I've understood what the purpose of a linter is and why it was useful. Wes' tutorial however gave some helpful elaborations of what a linter is capable of and how customizable you can get with it. One of the new first steps for future projects will be getting this set up.

Also found great resources for how clean JavaScript should be written authored by [Airbnb](https://airbnb.io/). They give great examples of how to go about doing common javascript things (such as [using the spread operator to copy arrays](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript#arrays--from-iterable)).

Many repos starred today for future reference!
