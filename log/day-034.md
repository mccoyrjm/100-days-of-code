**Today's Progress:** Practicing CSS Basics on Course Sample Site (finished home page and started /packages)

**Thoughts:** Feeling more competent in my CSS skills in general! We are still working on the [uHost](https://codesandbox.io/embed/p71ny96l40?view=preview) site as our consistent practice area for CSS exercises. Today, I was able to style sections before coding along with him which helped me practice the CSS properties we've been going over. I can only hope this knowledge sticks and will keep learning new CSS properties to keep my skills sharp!
