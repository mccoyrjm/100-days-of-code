# Day 39: December 6, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Finished up `position` property module of Udemy course.

**Thoughts:** Kudos for BarelyFitz Design's great resource on position-ing. The step-by-step process of going through the different property values helped cement a firm understanding of how each value works. Also learned about the `position: sticky` property value which seems like an interesting behavior to play around with! When it gains more browser support in the future, I'm sure we'll find some interesting applications for it.

Glad to be done with `position` though. I keep thinking of how other modern technologies can replace/mimic the behavior being presented here. But gotta stay patient and take it one step at a time.
