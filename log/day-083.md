# Day 83: April 29, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Converted clone of [ddlc.moe](https://ddlc.moe) to mobile-first markup/styling.

**Thoughts:** I noticed mid-way through yesterday that ddlc.moe is not responsive! So today was spent refactoring the markup and styling to adhere to mobile-first philosophy. VSCode has a cool extension called [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) that even allowed me to have access to the site via my local network from my iPhone 5SE! Being able to see the simulation in Firefox versus actual render on my phone pushed me to look back into how to configure the `<meta>` tag properly for responsive layout. This led me to re-learn how setting `"user-scalable=no"` can be inaccessible to some folk if they cannot read the text with the default zoom.

**Learning Resources:**
