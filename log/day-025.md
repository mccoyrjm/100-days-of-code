**Today's Progress:** CSS Inhertiance and CSS Combinators

**Thoughts:** Learned how inheritance works and created lots of example excercises done to practice with combinators. Ran into my first weird CSS behavior that didn't match up with the docs, so made a [tweet](https://twitter.com/_RyanRealMcCoy/status/1063120322935881728) about it. Hoping for some feedback from the community! ^^;
