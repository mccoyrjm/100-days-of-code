# Day 5: September 25, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Reviewed ES6 classes and new features for strings. Learned about .includes() function that returns a "does string contain substring" boolean value.

**Thoughts:** Taking my previous lessons learned into account from the past few days is continuing to pay off. I have used classes in TypeScript for the past couple years, but never knew about hoisting or what that meant. And going over new string features led me to discover the .includes() function which would have been helpful for NUMEROUS problems I've had to address!
