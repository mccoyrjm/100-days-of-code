# Day 12: October 3, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Went over arrow functions. Learned a valuable lesson in how arrow functions work with 'this'.

**Thoughts:** Today was an epiphany kind of day after going over how arrow functions affect the scope of 'this'. During my beginnings in web dev, I was obsessed with adding `const self = this;` at the beginning of every function to make sure the scope was being kept correctly. I remember being confused seeing other code that didn't have this and never bothered to investigate why it did and mine didn't. 

Argh!!! Past Ryan, why weren't you more curious???
