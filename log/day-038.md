# Day 38: December 5, 2018

**Today's Progress:** More research on position property

**Thoughts:** Felt unmotivated today and mostly skimmed through articles and examples explaining position. Hoping I'll feel more energized tomorrow and can get a firm understanding of position and how different combinations of elements with that property applied can affect each other.
