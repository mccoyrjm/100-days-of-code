**Today's Progress:** Flexbox History and Basics!

**Thoughts:** Pumped to be learning about this! Wondering how often I can rely on flexbox though if on future projects IE11 needs to be supported. Will have to look into that later at the end of this unit or whenever I start learning about backwards compatibility.
