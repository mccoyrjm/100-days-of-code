# Day 7: September 27, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Learned about how ES6 Maps and Sets are initialized and used.

**Thoughts:** Starting to see the point of Maps and Sets. After talking to my co-worker about them, he showed a few examples of where he has used them in our project which helped me get more excited about learning about them!

**Link(s) to work:**
* Sets - [JS Bin](https://jsbin.com/pubovobibo/edit?js,console)
* Maps - [JS Bin](https://jsbin.com/palecumifi/edit?js,console)
